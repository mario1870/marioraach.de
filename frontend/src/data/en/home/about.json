  "aboutText": "I'm 22 years old and come from Germany.<br/><br/>My background? Trained industrial clerk with a strong interest in web development and AI. Currently, I'm doing an internship at OXID eSales and will start my dual study program in Data Science and AI there in October. My goal is to combine my business knowledge with technical skills.<br/><br/>In my free time, you can often find me on the soccer field, at the dartboard, or playing chess. I enjoy exploring new technology and sometimes work on my own programming projects. Of course, I also make sure to spend plenty of time with friends :D"
